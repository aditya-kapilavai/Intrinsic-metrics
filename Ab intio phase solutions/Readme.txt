This folder contains generic finite solutions obtained from the ab-initio phase.

If one is interested in computing the closest singular configuration for a 3-RPR manipulator, then the generic finite solutions can be used. These solutions were achieved by employing "perfect path tracking" (refer to Table 5 - Table 8 in the paper). In this case, it is sufficient to run only user-defined homotopies and post-processing algorithms discussed in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.1.3 of the paper.

Below is the data for six randomly chosen complex coordinates to run user-defined homotopies:

K1 := <0,0>
K2 := <2/11+7I,0>
K3 := <11+I,5/7+2I>
K4 := <1+3/5I, 2/3-11I>
K5 := <2-2/3I, 1/5+7I>
K6 := <1/2+5/3I, 7/11-5/3I>"
