This folder contains generic finite solutions obtained from the ab-initio phase 

If one is interested in computing the closest singular configuration for a 3-RPR manipulator, then the generic finite solutions can be used, which  were achieved by ``perfect path tracking''  Table 5 -Table 8. In this case, it is sufficient to run only user-defined homotopies and post-processing algorithms  discussed in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.1.3  of the paper. 


Below is the data for 6 randomly chosen complex coordinates for running user-defined homotopies.

K1:=<0,0>, K2:=<2/11+7*I,0> K3:=<11+I,5/7+2*I>
K4:=<1+3/5*I, 2/3-11*I> K5:=<2-2/3*I, 1/5+7*I>, K6:=<1/2+5/3*I, 7/11-5/3*I>
