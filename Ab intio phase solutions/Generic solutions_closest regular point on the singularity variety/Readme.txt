This folder contains a summary of generic finite solutions obtained from the ab-initio phase for L as given by Eqs. (3.1) and (3.5) are provided in Table 5 of the paper.
In the user-defined homotopy phase, these solutions are start solutions and the corresponding number of paths are to be tracked for computing the critical points.
76 paths are to be tracked for interpretation 1: Both base and platform are with undeformable materials
858 paths are to be tracked for interpretation 2: The base is with undeformable material and the platform is a deformable triangular plate.
858 paths are to be tracked for interpretation 3:  The base is with undeformable material and the platform is a deformable pin-jointed triangular bar structure.
