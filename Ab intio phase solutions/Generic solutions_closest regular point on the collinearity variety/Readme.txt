This folder contains a summary of generic finite solutions obtained from the ab-initio phase for $L$, as given by Eq. 3.9 of the paper.
In the user-defined homotopy phase, 206 paths are to be tracked. The number 206 corresponds to the root count provided in Table 5 of the paper.

If you have any more text that needs correction or any other questions, feel free to ask!
