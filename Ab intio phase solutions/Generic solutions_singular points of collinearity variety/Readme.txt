 




This folder contains a summary of generic finite solutions obtained from the ab-initio phase for L as given by Eqs. (3.10) and (3.12) are provided in Table 8 of the paper.
In the user-defined homotopy phase, these solutions are start solutions and the corresponding number of paths are to be tracked for computing the critical points.
start 5 refers to 5 paths that are to be tracked for interpretation 3 and its inversion interpretation 7: Platform is a pin-jointed triangular bar structure. 

If you have any more text that needs correction or any other questions, feel free to ask.
