This folder contains a summary of generic finite solutions obtained from the ab-initio phase for L as given by Eqs. (3.2) and (3.7) are provided in Table 7 of the paper.
In the user-defined homotopy phase, these solutions are start solutions and the corresponding number of paths are to be tracked for computing the critical points.
If you have any more text that needs correction or any other questions, feel free to ask.
