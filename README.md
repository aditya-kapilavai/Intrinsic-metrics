This repository contains supplementary materials for the paper titled 
"Singularity Distance Computations of 3-RPR Manipulators Using Intrinsic Metrics" Authors: Aditya Kapilavai and Georg Nawratil.
Supplementary materials are animations which corresponds to Fig 4 of the paper and generic finite solutions obtained from ab-initio phase

Illustration of the nine considered interpretations of a 3-RPR  manipulator as planar frameworks, which are 
arranged in a 3x3 matrix. The latter is symmetric with respect to the exchange of the platform and the base, which can be achieved by considering the inverse motion of the manipulator.
