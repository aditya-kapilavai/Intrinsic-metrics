This repository contains supplementary materials for the paper titled 
"Singularity Distance Computations of 3-RPR Manipulators Using Intrinsic Metrics" Authors: Aditya Kapilavai and Georg Nawratil.
Supplementary materials are animations that correspond to Fig 4 of the paper and generic finite solutions obtained from the ab-initio phase

Illustration of the nine considered interpretations of a 3-RPR  manipulator as planar frameworks, which are 
arranged in a 3x3 matrix. The latter is symmetric with respect to the exchange of the platform and the base, which can be achieved by considering the inverse motion of the manipulator.

The computational pipeline is given by the following flow chart:
