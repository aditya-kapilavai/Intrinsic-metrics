This folder contains animations of the singularity distance measure for the nine interpretations presented in Fig. 4 of the paper. The chosen one-parametric metric motion is given in Eq. (5.2).

Interpretation 1: Both the base and platform are made of undeformable materials.
Interpretation 2: The base is with undeformable material and the platform is a triangular plate
Interpretation 3: The base is with undeformable material and the platform is a deformable pin-jointed triangular plate.
Interpretation 4: Inverse to interpretation 2, the base is a triangular plate and the platform is undeformable material.
Interpretation 5: Both base and platform are triangular plates
Interpretation 6: The platform is a pin-jointed triangular bar structure and the base is a triangular plate 
Interpretation 7: Inverse to interpretation 3, the base is a pin-jointed triangular bar structure and the platform is undeformable material. 
Interpretation 8: Inverse to interpretation 6, the platform is a triangular plate and the base is a pin-jointed triangular bar structure 
Interpretation 9: Both the base and platform are pin-jointed triangular bar structures. 



These singularity distance measures correspond to the closest regular point on V = 0. The given  nonsingular configuration is indicated in green, and the closest singular configuration is shown in red.

Please note that the one-parametric motion of the manipulator exhibits two singular configurations at φ = 0 and φ ≈ 3.0356972 radians.

We discretize the motion parameter φ into 90 poses within the interval of 0 to 2π."
