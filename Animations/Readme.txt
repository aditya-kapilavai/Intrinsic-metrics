This folder contains animations of singularit distance measure for the presented nine interpretations in Fig.2 of the paper
The corresponding singularity distance measures along the chosen 1-parametric metric motion of Eq. 5.2 are given in Fig 4.
These singularity distance measures which corresponds to the closest regular point on ùëâ = 0.
Given configuration is indicated in (green) and the closest singular configuration is shown in Red .


Note that the one-parametric motion of the manipulator exhibits two singular configurations at $\phi=0$ and $\phi\approx 3.0356972$ radians.

We discretize the motion parameter $\phi$ into 90 poses within the interval of $0$ to $2\pi$.
